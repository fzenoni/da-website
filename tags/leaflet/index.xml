 Introduction In the previous blog post, we talked about visualising the locations where meteorites struck Earth and we made some conclusions about the locations where these meteorites were found. What we didn’t touch upon yet is the meteorites’ mass. We will keep working with our cleaned meteorite data set, and we will aim to find out whether we can get some kind of mass distribution, and if we can use the meteorites’ mass in a global visualisation.</description>

 Meteorite sightings NASA has opened their database to the world at https://data.nasa.gov/, where they demonstrate their own test data and various measurements around the globe. One of the available datasets (which can be downloaded from this location) contains data on over 45 000 meteorites, including their chemical composition, their mass, and the year they were discovered and the corresponding location.</description>

      <description>Viewing and analysing GPS traces with R Nowadays most car drivers use GPS services to reach their destinations. Often this is done via a mobile phone, but soon connected cars will be the norm. As a consequence, the amount of geo-positional data of car trips is continuously increasing. In this blog post I will illustrate how we can use R to analyse and visualise GPS traces.</description>
