 Introduction In the previous blog post, we talked about visualising the locations where meteorites struck Earth and we made some conclusions about the locations where these meteorites were found. What we didn’t touch upon yet is the meteorites’ mass. We will keep working with our cleaned meteorite data set, and we will aim to find out whether we can get some kind of mass distribution, and if we can use the meteorites’ mass in a global visualisation.</description>

 Meteorite sightings NASA has opened their database to the world at https://data.nasa.gov/, where they demonstrate their own test data and various measurements around the globe. One of the available datasets (which can be downloaded from this location) contains data on over 45 000 meteorites, including their chemical composition, their mass, and the year they were discovered and the corresponding location.</description>
