      <description>Viewing and analysing GPS traces with RNowadays most car drivers use GPS services to reach their destinations. Often this is done via a mobile phone, but soon connected cars will be the norm. As a consequence, the amount of geo-positional data of car trips is continuously increasing. In this blog post I will illustrate how we can use R to analyse and visualise GPS traces.</description>

Where were weIn the previous post (click here if you missed it), we managed to put together a relatively short chunk of code that generated the following rather nice map of Brussels Region, which includes all of its 19 municipalities.
A new challenger appearsIn that post, we discussed how a certain amount of challenges were overcome.</description>

Drawing maps with RIn the last few years the R community has done big steps in providing friendly tools to manipulate tables extended by geographical information. The need to display such information in a simple way, coupled with the prescriptions of tidy data summarized by Hadley Wickham (https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10) led to the development of R packages such as sf and tmap, as well as considerable improvement of the well-known R graphic library, ggplot2.</description>

      <description>About us Our academic background is in engineering and/or physical sciences, and our job is all about making sense out of data. We&amp;rsquo;re spread between Brussels and Ghent (and sometimes Leuven). We created this blog in the attempt to give back some of the passion and love we got from the online community in all these years.</description>
