      <description>In this blog post, we analyse accidents and traffic data in the United Kingdom. The data are available for download on kaggle and contain UK government records of traffic from 2000 to 2016, as well as accidents recorded between 2005-2007 and 2009-2014. Using python and its modules pandas, numpy, glob, folium and seaborn we will visualise different aspects of the data and try to get some insight into trends and evolution of accidents and traffic in the UK.</description>

 Introduction In the previous blog post, we talked about visualising the locations where meteorites struck Earth and we made some conclusions about the locations where these meteorites were found. What we didn’t touch upon yet is the meteorites’ mass. We will keep working with our cleaned meteorite data set, and we will aim to find out whether we can get some kind of mass distribution, and if we can use the meteorites’ mass in a global visualisation.</description>

 Meteorite sightings NASA has opened their database to the world at https://data.nasa.gov/, where they demonstrate their own test data and various measurements around the globe. One of the available datasets (which can be downloaded from this location) contains data on over 45 000 meteorites, including their chemical composition, their mass, and the year they were discovered and the corresponding location.</description>

      <title>Viewing and analysing GPS traces with R</title>

      <description>Viewing and analysing GPS traces with R Nowadays most car drivers use GPS services to reach their destinations. Often this is done via a mobile phone, but soon connected cars will be the norm. As a consequence, the amount of geo-positional data of car trips is continuously increasing. In this blog post I will illustrate how we can use R to analyse and visualise GPS traces.</description>

 Where were we In the previous post (click here if you missed it), we managed to put together a relatively short chunk of code that generated the following rather nice map of Brussels Region, which includes all of its 19 municipalities.
 A new challenger appears In that post, we discussed how a certain amount of challenges were overcome.</description>

 Drawing maps with R In the last few years the R community has done big steps in providing friendly tools to manipulate tables extended by geographical information. The need to display such information in a simple way, coupled with the prescriptions of tidy data summarized by Hadley Wickham (https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10) led to the development of R packages such as sf and tmap, as well as considerable improvement of the well-known R graphic library, ggplot2.</description>
